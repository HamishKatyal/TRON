# Tron E-Bike Rental Project

## Introduction

Tron is an e-bike rental project designed to provide a convenient, eco-friendly, and cost-effective transportation solution for college students. This project leverages technology to streamline the process of renting and returning e-bikes, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system includes a mobile app and web portal for easy booking and management of e-bike rentals.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Users can track the availability and location of e-bikes in real-time.
- **Secure Payments**: The platform supports secure payment gateways for hassle-free transactions.
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Automated alerts for maintenance and servicing of e-bikes to ensure safety and reliability.

## Architecture

The Tron e-bike rental system is composed of the following components:
1. **Frontend**: A responsive web application and mobile app for users to interact with the system.
2. **Backend**: A robust server-side application that handles business logic, user authentication, and data management.
3. **Database**: A centralized database to store user information, rental history, and bike status.
4. **IoT Integration**: E-bikes are equipped with IoT devices for GPS tracking and status monitoring.

## Workflow

1. **Registration**: Users sign up and create an account on the platform.
2. **Booking**: Users can search for available e-bikes, select their preferred bike, and book it for a specific time period.
3. **Unlocking**: Once a booking is confirmed, users receive a unique code to unlock the e-bike.
4. **Ride**: Users can enjoy their ride and have the flexibility to park at designated stations.
5. **Return**: After the ride, users return the e-bike to a designated station and lock it securely.
